My name is **Luca**, I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Student at Alma Mater Studiorum Universit√† di Bologna.
Currently I'm working as a DevSecOps Engineer at [SIGHUP](https://sighup.io/).

In my free time I manage [PrimeTest](https://primetest.ga) a study community and 24/7 virtual study space for university students and freshers preparing for admission tests.
