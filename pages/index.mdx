# Luca Bandini

My name is **Luca**, I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Student at Alma Mater Studiorum Universit√† di Bologna.
I worked for three years as a Network Technician and one year as author for a tech news website.
Right now I'm involved in many personal and side projects.

I manage [PrimeTest](https://primetest.ga) a study community and 24/7 virtual study space for university students and freshers preparing for admission tests.
