# Luca Bandini

My name is **Luca**, **DevSecOps / Cloud Security Engineer** at [VeChain Foundation](https://vechain.org/), previosuly I worked as DevSecOps and DevOps Engineer at [SIGHUP](https://sighup.io/) (now part of [Reevo](https://reevo.it/)), passionate about Cloud, Cybersecurity, Networking and Coding.

When I am not hanging on the keyboard, I am certainly hanging on a boulder or a crag 🧗.

I serve as **Vice-Coordinator** at the **Civil Protection** volunteer group of Castel Bolognese, where I also co-lead the telecommunications department. Our team focuses on emergency communications and technical support during critical situations and natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and fires 👩‍🚒.
