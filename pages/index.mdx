# Luca Bandini

My name is Luca, I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Student at Alma Mater Studiorum Universit√† di Bologna, I worked for 3 years as a Network Technician and now I'm trying to fulfill my studies.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
